            <p>
                As I looked through the data, I found a few interesting observations.
                The first observation that I made was that when comparing the latitude to the max temperature,
                as the latitude increased from a negative number to zero, the max temperature went up,
                and when the number increased from 0 to a higher positive number, the max temperature began to decrease.
                This isn't unusual by any means. However, the decrease in temperature from 20 degrees to 60 degrees
                latitude
                is much steeper than the decrease from negative 20 to negative 60. If we look at the minumum values from
                negative 20 degrees latitude and positive 20 degrees latitude, which are both about 60 degrees,
                the negative 20 degrees latitude to negative 60 only drops by about 20 degrees. On the other hand,
                looking from positive 20 to positive 60, the temperature drops as much as 80 degrees, which is a
                massive difference. Granted, I'm not sure how the weather works, but one would expect that if two
                pieces of land are equidistant from the equator, they would be similar in temperature.
                As we see in the data though, this does not appear to be the case. I suppose that this is due
                to other factors such as longitude and altitude, and would need to be looked into further.

                The second observation that I made while looking through this data is for some reason,
                on both ends of the spectrum the humidity remains mostly the same.
                However, when you look at between 20 and 40 degrees latitude, whether positive or negative,
                there is a significant drop in humidity and then rises back to similar numbers as the ends
                of the spectrum when the latitude is closer to Zero. I'm not sure why in that particular area
                it is like that as well, and it would probably involve only certain areas that would need to be
                looked into further as well and would also be determined by other factors such as longitude and
                altitude.

                One last observation that I made is that wind speed is rather consistent across the spectrum,
                minus on the ends of the spectrum where the wind speed has some outliers that can be almost double
                that of most other areas. I'm guessing these would also be determined more so by other factors
                such as longitude and latitude as well.
